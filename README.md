# Build With

This web application is currently composed of two parts: 
- A backend written in Python using FastAPI.
- A frontend written in JavaScript using NuxtJS, a framework based on VueJS.

The parts are defined in the corresponding repository.

# Getting Started

At the moment, the application is not fully ready. We are working on it. Currently, you can run with docker the backend through docker compose. In future versions, we will also implement the frontend. Nevertheless, you can still run the application by going to the sub repository to see instructions.

```bash
docker compose up
```
